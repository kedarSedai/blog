An **API** is the Application programming interface. Actually, it is the set of rules that allows developer programmers to talk with each other. The developers create API on the server side and allows client to interact with each other.

**REST** stands for Representational State Transfer it is the way for two computers to communicate over HTTP in a similar way to web browsers and servers. It is the set of rules that developer follow while creating their APIs.
