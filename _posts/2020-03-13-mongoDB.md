**MongoDB** is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database. This tutorial give you great understanding on MongoDB concepts. 

You need to download and install MongoDB from it;s official site. [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-windows/)

**Basic commands on mongo shell** 

show all available database 
{% highlight mongoDB %}
show dbs;
{% endhighlight %}

Select a particular database to access, eg Student. This will create _Employee_ if it does not already exists.
{% highlight mongoDB %}
use Employee;
{% endhighlight %}

Show collection in database
{% highlight mongoDB %}
show collections;
{% endhighlight %}

To check the currently selected database use the command db
{% highlight mongoDB %}
db
{% endhighlight %}

Just type show dbs in your mongo shell and you will see available database 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mongodb/showdbs.PNG)

now type {% highlight mongoDB %} use Employee; {% endhighlight %} and you will se it switched to database Employee
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mongodb/useemployee.PNG)

Just create user with username, password and roles with following lines of code
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mongodb/createuser.PNG)

Now, we need to create collection. **Collection** may store a number of documents. A collection is analogous to a table of an RDBMS. 
{% highlight mongoDB %}
db.createCollection('Employee');
{% endhighlight %}

Now, let's insert data into collection using MongoDB's query 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mongodb/insert.PNG)

Inorder to see our data we need to write find() query
{% highlight mongoDB %}
db.Employee.find()
{% endhighlight %}

this output as:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mongodb/output.PNG)

let's pretify our document using preety() method. This is the method that pretty-prints resulting JSON.

We can use _save_ instead of _insert_ method. like
{% highlight mongoDB %}
db.Employee.save({first_name:'Thyame', last_name:'Sedhai'});
{% endhighlight %}
The difference with _save_ is that if the passed document contains an _id field, if a document already exists with that _id it will be updated instead of being added as new. 

Here, _insertOne_ is used to insert only one record and _insertMany_ to insert multiple records.
db.Employee.insertMany([{first_name:'Diple', last_name:'pant', age:23}, {first_name:'Sid', last_name:'Nurse', age:23}]);
and you can see the output as:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mongodb/insertmany.PNG)
